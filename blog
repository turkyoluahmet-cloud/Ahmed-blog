#My Pc Always Crashes At The Worst Moment
My PC has a very special talent: it always crashes at the worst possible moment. Not when I’m just browsing the internet or doing something unimportant, but exactly when I really need it. Right before I save an important file, during an online meeting, in the middle of a game without a recent save, or while rendering something critical.
Everything usually feels fine before it happens. The system runs smoothly, the fans are quiet, and nothing seems out of place. That’s the moment when I start trusting it again — and that trust never lasts long. Suddenly the screen freezes. No warning, no error message, just silence followed by an unexpected restart.
